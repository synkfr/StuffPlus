# Staff+

Staff+ is an enterprise-grade, high-performance moderation and utility plugin built for modern Minecraft networks. It ships as **two platform-specific JARs** — one for **Paper/Purpur/Folia** backend servers and one for **Velocity** proxies — sharing a unified core engine for consistent punishment management across your entire network.

**Paper Edition** runs on Paper/Purpur/Folia 1.20–1.21+ servers with full Folia multi-threaded region safety, and includes advanced staff tools like vanish, inventory inspection, and spectator monitoring.

**Velocity Edition** runs on Velocity 3.3.0+ proxies and enforces bans, IP-bans, and mutes at the network gateway before players even reach a backend server.

Both editions share the same database, configs, and migration system — deploy one or both depending on your setup.

## Features

### Cross-Platform Core

* **Shared Database**: Both Paper and Velocity editions read and write to the same punishment database (SQLite or MySQL), enabling seamless network-wide moderation.
* **Shared Configs**: `config.yml` and `messages.yml` use identical formats on both platforms via the Okaeri configuration framework.
* **Unified Migration Engine**: Import punishments from 7+ plugins on either platform.

### Folia Safety (Paper Edition)

* **Asynchronous Lifecycles**: All commands, database transactions, and packet actions run on Folia-compliant regional or asynchronous schedulers.
* **Folia Teleportation Safety**: Standard teleports are replaced with safe, non-blocking `teleportAsync` futures, completely preventing thread crashes.
* **Isolated Packet Loops**: Visually toggling features (like Vanish hide/show packets) are scheduled on each recipient's specific regional thread, guaranteeing thread-safety.

### Proxy Gateway Enforcement (Velocity Edition)

* **Pre-Login Ban Check**: Intercepts login attempts at the proxy level and rejects banned players before they reach any backend server.
* **Network-Wide Mute Filter**: Blocks chat messages from muted players across all connected servers.
* **IP-Ban Gateway**: Enforces IP bans at the proxy gateway, preventing banned IPs from connecting to any server in the network.

### Vanish (Paper Only)

* **Total Invisibility**: Completely removes the player from the online count, player ping lists, tab completions, and visible lists.
* **Physical Interaction Bypass**: Vanished staff bypass physical pressure plates and tripwire triggers entirely.
* **Silent Containers**: Allows opening chest, furnace, and barrel interfaces silently without triggering container animations or audio.
* **Stealth Suppression**: Prevents mob targeting, item pickups, and suppresses join/quit messages entirely while active.
* **Visual Action Bar Indicator**: Real-time HUD showing vanished status via safe asynchronous repeating tasks.

### Moderation (Both Platforms)

* **Comprehensive Actions**: Integrated `/ban`, `/tempban`, `/ip-ban`, `/tempip-ban`, `/mute`, `/tempmute`, and `/warn`.
* **Warning Profiles**: Track individual warning logs via `/warns <player> [list/clear]`.
* **Dynamic Time Parsing**: Sophisticated time parser supporting complex units (e.g. `1d`, `12h`, `45m`) and infinite duration mappings (`perm`).
* **Relational Storage**: Backed by a high-performance database manager supporting both local SQLite databases and remote MySQL servers, managed via a shaded, thread-safe HikariCP connection pool.
* **Linked Account Alt-Detection**: On player login, automatically scans, logs, and broadcasts alternate accounts sharing the IP address, color-coding active (green) and banned (red) profiles.
* **Dynamic Command & History Parity**: Multi-threaded `/history <player>`, `/staffhistory <staff>`, and `/staffrollback <staff>` commands supported by dynamic database-backed name tab completions.
* **Warning Escalation Ladder**: Scale punishments dynamically (e.g. tempmutes scaling to permanent bans) based on active warning levels. Command dispatches execute safely on each platform's native scheduler.
* **Non-Blocking Discord Webhook Logs**: Real-time embeds logging all mute, ban, and warning dispatches using modern non-blocking Java 21 `HttpClient` interfaces with zero impact on region ticks.
* **Administrative Overwrite Hierarchy Protection**: Custom staff weight ranks (`staff.hierarchy.weight.<number>`) blocking junior staff from overriding, deactivating, or removing punishments placed by senior administrators or the Console (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`).
* **IP-Ban Exemption Bypass**: Whitelist specific accounts (`/staffallow`) to connect and bypass active IP-bans without lifting the IP ban itself for other accounts sharing the IP.

### Punishment Importer & Migration (Both Platforms)

* **7 Supported Platforms**: Seamlessly import mutes, bans, warnings, and IP bans from:
  * **Vanilla Minecraft**: Direct imports from `banned-players.json` and `banned-ips.json` in the server root.
  * **Essentials / EssentialsX**: Automated scans of mutes and bans in user profiles under `plugins/Essentials/userdata/*.yml`.
  * **LiteBans**: Migrates bans, mutes, and warnings from H2/SQLite/MySQL databases. Supports auto-detection of the `litebans.mv.db` H2 file or manual JDBC parameters.
  * **AdvancedBan**: Integrates and normalizes legacy SQL `Punishments` tables from SQLite or MySQL.
  * **MaxBans**: Migration of bans, IP bans, mutes, and warnings from SQLite or MySQL.
  * **BanManager**: Integrates historical player bans, mutes, and warnings with configurable table prefixes.
  * **BungeeAdminTools (BAT)**: Imports entries from database tables `bat_ban` and `bat_mute`.
* **Dynamic Auto-Scanning**: Scans your server's active files on command, extracts SQLite paths or remote SQL database credentials, and allows zero-configuration migrations.
* **Batch Operations**: Commits imported records inside a single transaction using batch inserts, migrating thousands of records instantly.
* **Non-Blocking Futures**: Runs connection setups, configuration decodes, and database commits fully asynchronously on non-blocking thread pools.

### Spectator Follow (Paper Only)

* **Cinematic Camera Tracking**: Teleports staff in spectator mode to follow the target seamlessly.
* **Velocity-Predicted Follow**: Computes target movements and velocity vectors (`target.getVelocity()`) to position the camera slightly ahead of the target, eliminating stutter and rubber-banding.
* **Throttled Teleports**: Auto-updates run at a throttled 4-tick (200ms) interval with a 400ms cooldown, giving client-side predicted movements and Paper's async teleportation futures time to fully resolve.
* **Configurable Boundary Tether**: Allows staff to orbit or move freely within a 10-block radius. Going beyond the boundary gently tethers the camera back into offset.

### Inventory Inspector (Paper Only)

* **54-Slot Live GUI**: View and edit target players' main inventories (0-35), armor slots (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots), off-hand items, and stats.
* **Live Stats & Shortcuts**:
  * **Golden Apple**: Displays health, food levels, and experience dynamically.
  * **Potion Bottle**: Shows a live list of active potion effects and durations.
  * **Ender Chest**: Quick-access shortcut item to inspect their Ender Chest directly.
* **Unparalleled Folia Safety**: Completely avoids asynchronous block-state reads (which crash under Folia when querying `.getOpenInventory().getTopInventory().getHolder()` on block-based inventories in other regions). Instead, it implements a thread-safe custom session registry that cleanly tracks active inspect views and propagates updates regionally.

### Shortcuts (Paper Only)

* **Instant Gamemode Shifts**: Rapid commands including creative (`/gmc`), survival (`/gms`), spectator (`/gmsp`), and adventure (`/gma`).
* **Flight Mode**: Seamless command flight toggles via `/fly`.

## Build & Compilation

Staff+ is a **multi-module Gradle project** producing two independent shaded JARs.

### Requirements

* **Java 21** or higher
* **Gradle** (installed or via wrapper)

### Build Command

Compile and build both platform JARs:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

The compiled plugins will be located at:

```
staff-paper/build/libs/StaffPlus-Paper-1.0.0.jar    # Paper/Purpur/Folia servers
staff-velocity/build/libs/StaffPlus-Velocity-1.0.0.jar  # Velocity proxies
```

### Project Structure

```
StaffPlus/
├── staff-core/          # Shared platform-agnostic library
│   └── src/main/java/   # Database, Punishment model, Configs, Migration, Utils
├── staff-paper/         # Paper/Folia backend plugin
│   └── src/main/java/   # Paper commands, listeners, vanish, monitor, invsee
├── staff-velocity/       # Velocity proxy plugin
│   └── src/main/java/   # Velocity commands, login/chat listeners
├── build.gradle          # Root configuration
└── settings.gradle       # Multi-module declaration
```

*Note: The Gradle shadow configuration automatically relocates `eu.okaeri`, `com.zaxxer.hikari`, `org.h2`, and `org.xerial` libraries to private namespaces (`me.ayosynk.staff.libs.*`) to prevent conflicts with any other plugins on the classpath.*

---

## Continuous Integration

`Staff+` implements a fully automated CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions to compile, validate, and distribute artifacts for **both platforms**.

### Dev Builds

* **Frequency**: Built automatically on every `push` to the `master` or `main` branches.
* **Release Target**: Published under the rolling **[dev-latest](https://github.com/synkfr/StaffPlus/releases/tag/dev-latest)** pre-release tag on GitHub.
* **Rolling Policy**: The pipeline automatically overwrites the previous `dev-latest` tag on every build, maintaining a clean releases page.
* **Artifacts**: Both `StaffPlus-Paper` and `StaffPlus-Velocity` JARs are published in every release.

### Stable Releases

* **Frequency**: Generated whenever a semantic Git version tag matching `v*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`) is pushed to the repository.
* **Release Target**: Published as a dedicated production release containing formal release notes and both platform-ready shaded JAR assets.

---

## bStats Metrics

Both editions of Staff+ integrate with [bStats](https://bstats.org/) to collect anonymous usage statistics. This helps us understand how the plugin is being used and guides future development.

* **Paper Edition**: Uses `bstats-bukkit` for server-side metrics.
* **Velocity Edition**: Uses `bstats-velocity` (Plugin ID: `31693`) for proxy-side metrics.

If you wish to opt-out of anonymous metrics collection, you can disable it by navigating to the `plugins/bStats/config.yml` file on your server or proxy and setting `enabled: false`.

---

## Developer Notes

For developers looking at the source code of Staff+, here is a summary of the architecture:

### Multi-Module Architecture

1. **staff-core**: Platform-agnostic shared library containing the database layer, punishment model, config system, migration engine, and utility classes. Uses `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` for async operations — no platform-specific scheduler dependencies.
2. **staff-paper**: Paper/Folia plugin implementing `StaffPlatform` interface. Contains all Paper-specific commands, listeners, vanish, monitor, invsee, and gamemode shortcuts. Uses Folia-safe regional schedulers.
3. **staff-velocity**: Velocity proxy plugin implementing `StaffPlatform` interface. Contains proxy-level commands and login/chat event listeners for network-wide enforcement.

### Folia Threading Rules (Paper)

1. **Async Teleportation**: Never call `Player#teleport()` on Folia. Always use `Player#teleportAsync()` and queue dependent actions using `.thenRun()` or `.thenAccept()`.
2. **Recipient Thread Safety**: Action updates (like `recipient.hidePlayer()` or `recipient.showPlayer()`) must execute on the **recipient's** regional thread context. Wrap these calls in `SchedulerUtils.runEntity(plugin, recipient, ...)` to guarantee packet delivery.
3. **Avoid cross-region block state reads**: Calling `open.getHolder()` on block-based inventories open in other regions throws threading exceptions. Instead, maintain an in-memory, thread-safe registry of `InvseeSession` objects.
4. **Cinematic Follow Damping**: Use interval checking (≥4 ticks), velocity extrapolation, and a task cooldown to maintain smooth follower views.
