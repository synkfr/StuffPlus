# Stuff+

Stuff+ is an enterprise-grade, high-performance moderation and utility plugin built for modern Minecraft networks. It is designed from the ground up to support Folia's multi-threaded region architecture as well as standard Paper / Spigot (1.20 - 1.21+) servers.

By utilizing regional entity schedulers, thread-safe packet delivery pipelines, and robust data isolation, Stuff+ delivers advanced administrative utilities without ever risking main-thread locks or cross-thread race conditions.

## Features

### Folia Safety
* **Asynchronous Lifecycles**: All commands, database transactions, and packet actions run on Folia-compliant regional or asynchronous schedulers.
* **Folia Teleportation Safety**: Standard Bukkit teleports are replaced with safe, non-blocking `teleportAsync` futures, completely preventing thread crashes.
* **Isolated Packet Loops**: Visually toggling features (like Vanish hide/show packets) are scheduled on each recipient's specific regional thread, guaranteeing thread-safety.

### Vanish
* **Total Invisibility**: Completely removes the player from the online count, player ping lists, tab completions, and visible lists.
* **Physical Interaction Bypass**: Vanished staff bypass physical pressure plates and tripwire triggers entirely.
* **Silent Containers**: Allows opening chest, furnace, and barrel interfaces silently without triggering container animations or audio.
* **Stealth Suppression**: Prevents mob targeting, item pickups, and suppresses join/quit messages entirely while active.
* **Visual Action Bar Indicator**: Real-time HUD showing vanished status via safe asynchronous repeating tasks.

### Moderation
* **Comprehensive Actions**: Integrated `/ban`, `/tempban`, `/ip-ban`, `/tempip-ban`, `/mute`, `/tempmute`, and `/warn`.
* **Warning Profiles**: Track individual warning logs via `/warns <player> [list/clear]`.
* **Dynamic Time Parsing**: Sophisticated time parser supporting complex units (e.g. `1d`, `12h`, `45m`) and infinite duration mappings (`perm`).
* **Relational Storage**: Backed by a high-performance database manager supporting both local SQLite databases and remote MySQL servers, managed via a shaded, thread-safe HikariCP connection pool.

### Punishment Importer & Migration
* **7 Supported Platforms**: Seamlessly import mutes, bans, warnings, and IP bans from:
  * **Vanilla Minecraft**: Direct imports from `banned-players.json` and `banned-ips.json` in the server root.
  * **Essentials / EssentialsX**: Automated scans of mutes and bans in user profiles under `plugins/Essentials/userdata/*.yml`.
  * **LiteBans**: Migrates bans, mutes, and warnings from SQL/SQLite connection structures.
  * **AdvancedBan**: Integrates and normalizes legacy SQL `Punishments` tables.
  * **MaxBans**: Dynamic name-to-UUID resolving and migration of bans, IP bans, mutes, and warnings.
  * **BanManager**: Integrates historical player bans, mutes, and warnings.
  * **BungeeAdminTools**: Imports entries from database tables `bat_ban` and `bat_mute`.
* **Dynamic Auto-Scanning**: Scans your server's active files on command, extracts SQLite paths or remote SQL database credentials, and allows zero-configuration migrations.
* **Batch Operations**: Commits imported records inside a single transaction using batch inserts, migrating thousands of records instantly.
* **Non-Blocking Futures**: Runs connection setups, configuration decodes, and database commits fully asynchronously on non-blocking thread pools.

### Spectator Follow
* **Cinematic Camera Tracking**: Teleports staff in spectator mode to follow the target seamlessly.
* **Velocity-Predicted Follow**: Computes target movements and velocity vectors (`target.getVelocity()`) to position the camera slightly ahead of the target, eliminating stutter and rubber-banding.
* **Throttled Teleports**: Auto-updates run at a throttled 4-tick (200ms) interval with a 400ms cooldown, giving client-side predicted movements and Paper's async teleportation futures time to fully resolve.
* **Configurable Boundary Tether**: Allows staff to orbit or move freely within a 10-block radius. Going beyond the boundary gently tethers the camera back into offset.

### Inventory Inspector
* **54-Slot Live GUI**: View and edit target players' main inventories (0-35), armor slots (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots), off-hand items, and stats.
* **Live Stats & Shortcuts**:
  * **Golden Apple**: Displays health, food levels, and experience dynamically.
  * **Potion Bottle**: Shows a live list of active potion effects and durations.
  * **Ender Chest**: Quick-access shortcut item to inspect their Ender Chest directly.
* **Unparalleled Folia Safety**: Completely avoids asynchronous block-state reads (which crash under Folia when querying `.getOpenInventory().getTopInventory().getHolder()` on block-based inventories in other regions). Instead, it implements a thread-safe custom session registry that cleanly tracks active inspect views and propagates updates regionally.

### Shortcuts
* **Instant Gamemode Shifts**: Rapid commands including creative (`/gmc`), survival (`/gms`), spectator (`/gmsp`), and adventure (`/gma`).
* **Flight Mode**: Seamless command flight toggles via `/fly`.

## Build & Compilation

To build the plugin and create a fully shaded/relocated JAR ready for production:

### Requirements
* **Java 21** or higher
* **Gradle** (installed or via wrapper)

### Build Command
Compile and build the shadow JAR:
```bash
gradle shadowJar
```

The compiled plugin will be located at:
```
build/libs/Stuff-1.0.0.jar
```

*Note: The Gradle shadow configuration automatically relocates `eu.okaeri` and `com.zaxxer.hikari` libraries to private namespaces (`me.ayosynk.stuff.libs.*`) to prevent conflicts with any other plugins on the classpath.*

---

## Continuous Integration

`Stuff+` implements a fully automated CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions to compile, validate, and distribute artifacts:

### Dev Builds
* **Frequency**: Built automatically on every `push` to the `master` or `main` branches.
* **Release Target**: Published under the rolling **[dev-latest](https://github.com/synkfr/StuffPlus/releases/tag/dev-latest)** pre-release tag on GitHub.
* **Rolling Policy**: The pipeline automatically overwrites the previous `dev-latest` tag on every build, maintaining a clean releases page. Administrators can always access the absolute latest development features and hotfixes at this stable release target.

### Stable Releases
* **Frequency**: Generated whenever a semantic Git version tag matching `v*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`) is pushed to the repository.
* **Release Target**: Published as a dedicated production release containing formal release notes and the production-ready shaded JAR asset.

## bStats Metrics

Stuff+ integrates with [bStats](https://bstats.org/) to collect anonymous usage statistics. This helps us understand how the plugin is being used and guides future development.

If you wish to opt-out of anonymous metrics collection, you can disable it by navigating to your server's `plugins/bStats/config.yml` file and setting `enabled: false`.

## Developer Notes

For developers looking at the source code of Stuff+, here is a summary of region-threading safety rules integrated into this repository:

1. **Async Teleportation**: Never call `Player#teleport()` on Folia. Always use `Player#teleportAsync()` and queue dependent actions using `.thenRun()` or `.thenAccept()`.
2. **Recipient Thread Safety**: Action updates (like `recipient.hidePlayer()` or `recipient.showPlayer()`) must execute on the **recipient's** regional thread context. Wrap these calls in `SchedulerUtils.runEntity(plugin, recipient, ...)` to guarantee packet delivery.
3. **Avoid cross-region block state reads**: Calling `open.getHolder()` on block-based inventories (e.g., Chests, Furnaces) open in other regions throws threading exceptions. Instead, maintain an in-memory, thread-safe registry of `InvseeSession` objects to update live inventories without world queries.
4. **Cinematic Follow Damping**: Issuing `teleportAsync` to follow players every single tick saturates client-side movement buffers. Use interval checking (≥4 ticks), velocity extrapolation, and a task cooldown to maintain smooth follower views.
