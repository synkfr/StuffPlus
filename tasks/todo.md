## Review & Verification Results

### 1. Compiles and Shading Integrity
- Successfully compiled the plugin with `./gradlew clean build`.
- Generated shaded shadow JAR size: ~456 KB.
- Shaded package names relocated under `me.ayosynk.staff.libs.*` to prevent classpath pollution:
  - `eu.okaeri.configs` relocated successfully.
  - `com.zaxxer.hikari` relocated successfully.

### 2. Phase 16: IP-Ban Allow Exemption Bypass
- Added `staff_allows` tracking table in SQLITE/MYSQL.
- Programmed native `/staffallow <player> [remove]` command (with aliases `/allow`, `/allowip`).
- Wired pre-login connection verification. Whitelisted UUIDs completely bypass IP-ban blocks, allowing safe connection of players sharing a banned IP while keeping the IP ban fully active for others.
- Wired hierarchical weight checking. Lower-ranking staff members are blocked from adding or removing IP ban exemptions for accounts banned by senior administrators.

### 3. Phase 17: Multi-Source Importer & Migration System
- Programmed batch transaction imports in a single transaction, supporting MySQL/SQLite backends.
- Formulated automatic database scanners mapping local SQLite files and remote SQL databases automatically.
- Extensively supports imports from: Vanilla bans, Essentials mutes/bans, LiteBans, AdvancedBan, MaxBans, BanManager, and BungeeAdminTools.
- Built interactive command display `/staffimport` showing active autodetected configuration directories.

### 4. General Framework Stability
- Fully compatible with Folia's multi-threaded region-threading context.
- Zero main-thread blocking operations. All DB transactions, UUID resolves, and external logging actions execute on asynchronous execution pools or regional task loops.

### 5. Phase 18: Git Commits Partitioning
- Organized the multi-module project changes into 12 granular, distinct, and logical Git commits following Conventional Commits.
- Verified commit progression with `git log` and ensured the workspace builds successfully.

### 6. Phase 19: Rename Stuff to Staff
- Renamed all directories and build configurations from stuff to staff.
- Refactored all Java package declarations and imports to use `me.ayosynk.staff`.
- Updated all plugin commands, permissions, and database tables to use "staff".
- Renamed display names, logs, metrics, workflows, and documentation pages from Stuff+ to Staff+.
- Verified clean build producing `StaffPlus-Paper-1.0.0.jar` and `StaffPlus-Velocity-1.0.0.jar`.

### 7. Phase 20: Staff Info GUI & command
- Implemented `/staff info <player>` command opening an interactive chest inventory GUI.
- Shows dynamic connections, warnings, alts, and exemption statuses.
- Provides clickable punish-shortcuts (kick, warn, mute, ban, clear history, and toggle whitelist bypass) utilizing hierarchy weight permission checks.
- Safely handles offline players by turning active buttons to red glass panes.
- Compiles successfully without warnings/errors under Paper/Folia.

### 8. Phase 21: Customizable Staff Info GUI via YAML & Reload Command
- Removed default italics globally across item names/lore by altering the MiniMessage parsing decorator.
- Extracted all `/staff info` layout characteristics (title, size, materials, names, slots list, fill item, and placeholders) to `menus/staff_info.yml` following the zmenu YAML schema format.
- Implemented a robust `MenuManager` parser catching parsing or validation errors (invalid YAML syntax, invalid materials, bad sizes, out of bound slots) and logging warning reports while dynamically falling back to standard configuration settings.
- Wired `/staff reload` console and player command executing real-time reloads of config, messages, and GUI files.
- Completed full unit test validation (`MenuManagerTest.java`) confirming graceful error handling and correct default settings fallback under invalid YAML/logical configurations.
- Verified compilation builds cleanly and generated shaded JAR.

### 9. Phase 22: Fix spectator target restoration exception
- Added a game mode check `staff.getGameMode() == GameMode.SPECTATOR` prior to calling `staff.setSpectatorTarget(null)` in `restoreSpectatorState`.
- Verified the build compiles successfully with `./gradlew clean build`.
