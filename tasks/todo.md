## Review & Verification Results

### 1. Compiles and Shading Integrity
- Successfully compiled the plugin with `./gradlew clean build`.
- Generated shaded shadow JAR size: ~456 KB.
- Shaded package names relocated under `me.ayosynk.stuff.libs.*` to prevent classpath pollution:
  - `eu.okaeri.configs` relocated successfully.
  - `com.zaxxer.hikari` relocated successfully.

### 2. Phase 16: IP-Ban Allow Exemption Bypass
- Added `stuff_allows` tracking table in SQLITE/MYSQL.
- Programmed native `/stuffallow <player> [remove]` command (with aliases `/allow`, `/allowip`).
- Wired pre-login connection verification. Whitelisted UUIDs completely bypass IP-ban blocks, allowing safe connection of players sharing a banned IP while keeping the IP ban fully active for others.
- Wired hierarchical weight checking. Lower-ranking staff members are blocked from adding or removing IP ban exemptions for accounts banned by senior administrators.

### 3. Phase 17: Multi-Source Importer & Migration System
- Programmed batch transaction imports in a single transaction, supporting MySQL/SQLite backends.
- Formulated automatic database scanners mapping local SQLite files and remote SQL databases automatically.
- Extensively supports imports from: Vanilla bans, Essentials mutes/bans, LiteBans, AdvancedBan, MaxBans, BanManager, and BungeeAdminTools.
- Built interactive command display `/stuffimport` showing active autodetected configuration directories.

### 4. General Framework Stability
- Fully compatible with Folia's multi-threaded region-threading context.
- Zero main-thread blocking operations. All DB transactions, UUID resolves, and external logging actions execute on asynchronous execution pools or regional task loops.

### 5. Phase 18: Git Commits Partitioning
- Organized the multi-module project changes into 12 granular, distinct, and logical Git commits following Conventional Commits.
- Verified commit progression with `git log` and ensured the workspace builds successfully.
